<h2>Web of Trust</h2>

<p>
  PGP public key and CAcert certificate identification are based on multiple
  (the more the better) people doing an identification check against official
  identity documents such as driving permits, passports, national identity
  cards, etc.: the Web of Trustworthy.  The Web of Trust is a reciprocal
  process: people identify themselves to each other.
</p>

<p>
  The "keysigning party" is essential to strengthen the Web of Trust and keep
  the security technique open and freely available.
</p>

<p>
  Like previous years, there will be a PGP key signing and CAcert assurance
  party at FOSDEM 2011.
</p>

<h2>PGP Keysigning</h2>

<p>
  If you intend to participate in the PGP keysigning event at FOSDEM 2011,
  please submit the keys you would like to have signed to the keyserver
  listening on <code>ksp.fosdem.org</code>.  If you are using GnuPG, this can
  easily be accomplished with:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
  <code>% gpg --keyserver ksp.fosdem.org --send-key [keyid]</code>
</p>

<p>
  You may want to verify that your submission made it to the keyserver by
  checking the list of submitted keys at <a
  href="http://ksp.fosdem.org/">http://ksp.fosdem.org/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The deadline for submissions is <strong>Monday 31 January 2011</strong>.
  After this date, the keyserver will no longer accept submissions and the
  official keylist will be published.  Further instructions on what to do with
  the keylist and how to participate in the keysigning party itself will be
  communicated at that time.
</p>

<h2>CAcert Assurances</h2>

<p>
  To participate in the CAcert assurance program, you need to register an
  account on the <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CAcert website</a> and
  download the CAcert Certificate Assurance Programme (CAP) form.
</p>

<p>
  You will need a completed form for every assurance.  It is recommended to
  bring at least ten printed forms with you.
</p>
