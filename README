This directory contains voodoo for keysigning.

Scripts
-------

 o kspd.pl -- key submission server.
   Start this as user ksp:
     su -s /bin/sh -c "/home/services/ksp/kspd.pl" ksp
   Writes received keys to keys/* with filename keyid.

 o klist.sh -- key list generator.
   Generates a pretty-printable list of keys from the
   keys in keys/* and klist.head.  Uses kstats.pl to
   add some statistics for every key.

 o kstats.pl -- key statistics.
   Looks up statistics for every key.  Used internally
   by klist.sh.  Probably shouldn't be touched. :-)

 o subgraph.pl -- graph submissions.
   Hackish script to throw submissions-per-day into
   rrdtool to prove procrastination by participants.
   
   - Note this runs from cron - the cronjob should be
     stopped when submissions close!

   - Actually, just test for kspd.lock.

Miscellaneous
-------------

 o htdocs/ contains symlinks to the submission scripts
   for anyone who wants to review them (what fun!).

Sequence of events

    o Run klist.sh
    o Verify hashes with someone
    o Sign the list
