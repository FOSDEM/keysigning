This repository contains the voodoo that is used to run FOSDEM keysigning
events.  It is shared on github so that people requesting features can just
implement them themselves.  Perhaps our infrastructure is also useful to
others organizing similar events?

There is no particular order here.  This all grew organically over years of
organizing FOSDEM keysigning events.  Parts were written by FOSDEM, parts by
others.  Most files have a licence block.  Files without a licence block are
placed in the public domain.

Share and enjoy!

Table of contents (roughly):
----------------------------

Scripts
-------

 o kspd.pl -- key submission server.
   Start this as user ksp on apeiron.fosdem.org:
     su -s /bin/sh -c "/var/ksp/kspd.pl" ksp
   Writes received keys to keys/* with filename keyid.
   Refuses submissions if a kspd.lock file is present.

 o klist.head.sh -- generate list header for this year
   Generates the klist.head file with this edition's
   year number in there. Called by klist.sh.

 o klist.sh -- key list generator.
   Generates a pretty-printable list of keys from the
   keys in keys/* and klist.head.  Uses kstats.pl to
   add some statistics for every key.

 o kstats.pl -- key statistics.
   Looks up statistics for every key.  Used internally
   by klist.sh.  Probably shouldn't be touched. :-)

 o subgraph.pl -- graph submissions.
   Hackish script to throw submissions-per-day into
   rrdtool to prove procrastination by participants.
   
   - Runs as a cronjob on apeiron.fosdem.org
   - Bails out if it finds a kspd.lock

Miscellaneous
-------------

 o htdocs/ contains symlinks to the submission scripts
   for anyone who wants to review them (what fun!).

 o Use paps --columns=2 --font=Monospace\ 5 ksp-fosdemXXXX.txt
   to print the keylist.


TODO / nice to have
-------------------

 o Have kspd listen on IPv6 as well
   - HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of IO::Socket::INET and will
     probably never get IPv6 support (though ugly patches do exist).
   - It should not be too difficult to write our own, but ... meh.
   - In the mean time, we have a socat proxy:
     % socat TCP6-LISTEN:11371,bind=ksp.fosdem.org,ipv6only,fork,su=ksp \
          TCP4:ksp.fosdem.org:11371

 o Provide a way to delete the keys
   - Authentication is an issue...


Sequence of events for a FOSDEM
-------------------------------

  Kickoff, mid-December:

    o Archive previous years state (mv to year directory)
      % mkdir $prevyear
      % mv files graphs keys output $prevyear/.
      % mkdir files graphs keys
      % chgrp ksp files graphs keys
      % chmod g+w files graphs keys
    o Remove the kspd.lock file
    o Adjust the dates in subgraph.pl
      - Note that the 'start date' should be yesterday
    o Run subgraph.pl manually to bootstrap the graph
      % sudo -u ksp perl ./subgraph.pl
    o Remember to adjust the vhost configuration
      - / should redirect to /keys, not /files
    o Send email (announce/0_announce.mail) to fosdem@
    o Update the dates in the keysigning: stanza of the
      website's config.yaml and regenerate the website

  List generation, week before FOSDEM:

    o Touch kspd.lock to stop submissions
    o Run klist.sh
    o Verify hashes with someone
    o Sign the list
    o Put in files/ksp-fosdemXXXX.txt{,.asc}
      - Note: *not* the hashes file! This motivates people to verify
        the hashes themselves.
    o Also copy the keyring there
    o Update the vhost.conf to change the redirect

    o Send email (announce/1_list.mail) to fosdem@
    o Update website
      - In the Nanoc site, it should be sufficient to edit the
        keysigning-section of config.yaml
