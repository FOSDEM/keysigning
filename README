This directory contains voodoo for keysigning.

Scripts:

 o kspd.pl -- key submission server.
   Start this as user ksp:
     su -s /bin/sh -c "/home/services/ksp/kspd.pl" ksp
   Writes received keys to keys/* with filename keyid.

 o klist.sh -- key list generator.
   Generates a pretty-printable list of keys from the
   keys in keys/* and klist.head.  Uses kstats.pl to
   add some statistics for every key.

 o kstats.pl -- key statistics.
   Looks up statistics for every key.  Used internally
   by klist.sh.  Probably shouldn't be touched. :-)

 o subgraph.pl -- graph submissions.
   Hackish script to throw submissions-per-day into
   rrdtool to prove procrastination by participants.

Miscellaneous:

 o htdocs/ contains symlinks to the submission scripts
   for anyone who wants to review them (what fun!).

 o Because we don't trust content damagement systems,
   we also keep website announcements there.  Ideally
   we should just be able to use the webby thing's
   internal "version control" to bring up the website
   from year to year

Things to remember for next years:

 o Before announcing the keysigning, clear keys/*.
   - actually, mv keys keys.year; mkdir keys
 o When the submission deadline expires, touch kspd.lock.
 o ...

How did generating lists work again?
What was the graphing stuff for?
