<h2>PGP Keysigning</h2>

<p>
  If you intend to participate in the PGP keysigning event at FOSDEM 2011,
  you should have submitted your key to the keyserver before the deadline.
  The final list of participants is now available.  If you are not on the
  list, you will not be able to participate.  Check for announcements and
  submit your key in time for next year's even.
</p>

<p>
  If you are participating in the keysigning event (ie: you have submitted
  your key to the keyserver), you should now download the final list of
  participants and follow its instructions closely.

  The final list of participants is available from

  If there is a trust-path between you and the author, you should verify
  the list's detached signature using:

  <code>% gpg --verify ksp-fosdem2011.txt.asc ksp-fosdem2011.txt</code>

  Please bring the printed list, a pen and appropriate form of identification
  with you to FOSDEM on Sunday.  Be on time!

<h3>Submission / Web of Trust Graphs</h3>
<p>
  During the submission period, graphs have been generated of the density
  of the web of trust and the rate at which keys were being submitted.  You
  can find these graphs at:
