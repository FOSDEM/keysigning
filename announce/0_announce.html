<h2>PGP Keysigning</h2>

<p>
  If you intend to participate in the PGP keysigning event at FOSDEM 2011,
  you must submit the keys you would like to have signed to the keyserver
  listening on <code>ksp.fosdem.org</code>.  If you are using GnuPG, this can
  easily be accomplished with:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
  <code>% gpg --keyserver ksp.fosdem.org --send-key [keyid]</code>
</p>

<p>
  You may want to verify that your submission made it to the keyserver by
  checking the list of submitted keys at <a
  href="http://ksp.fosdem.org/">http://ksp.fosdem.org/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The deadline for submissions is <strong>Monday 31 January 2011</strong>.
  After this date, the keyserver will no longer accept submissions and the
  official keylist will be published.  Further instructions on what to do with
  the keylist and how to participate in the keysigning party itself will be
  communicated at that time.
</p>

<h3>Submission / Web of Trust Graphs</h3>
<p>
  During the submission period, graphs will be generated of the density
  of the web of trust and the rate at which keys are being submitted.  You
  can find these graphs at:
  <a href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/graphs/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/graphs/</a>
