<h2>PGP Keysigning</h2>

<p>
  If you participated in the keysigning event at FOSDEM 2012, but missed
  (parts of) the participant list hashes as they flashed by during the
  starting presentation, you should verify the hashes before signing any
  keys.
</p>

<p>
  The hashes can now be downloaded from
  <a href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/</a>
  If there is a trust-path between you and the author, you should verify
  the file's detached signature using:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
  <code>% gpg --verify ksp-fosdem2012-hashes.txt.asc ksp-fosdem2012-hashes.txt</code>
</p>

<p>
  Please complete your signing homework before <strong>Sunday 10 June 2012</strong>,
  and upload new signatures on your keys to a well-connected keyserver.  New statistics
  of the density of the web of trust at FOSDEM will be published on that date.
</p>
