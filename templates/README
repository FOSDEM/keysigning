Welcome to the FOSDEM key signing event server.

Here you can download the official key list for the event.  The only
official file is the "ksp-fosdem${YEAR}.txt" file in the root directory.
This will be the file of which the hashes will be compared at the event
itself.

Besides this official list, we also provide non-authoritative files that may
make your life easier.  It is up to you, the participant, to verify that
these files actually contain the same information than the official list:
e.g. for the `keyring.gpg` file, you could run the `keylist.txt.sh` script
and verify that the output similar enough to the official list.  Note that
different GnuPG version may output slightly different output.  In
particular, GnuPG older than version 2.1 uses a different key format [1].
